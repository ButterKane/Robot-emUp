DESCRIPTION:
------------

This asset uses Unity's Projector component to produce an effect that mimics cloud shadows moving over a surface.

RESOURCES INCLUDED: 
-------------------

* CloudShadows.shader
* cloud-shadows.bmp
* cloud-shadows-noise.bmp
* cloud-shadows-inverted.bmp

HOW TO USE:
-----------

Import the custom package into your project. (Assets > Import Packabe > Custom Package)
Drag the included Prefab into your scene and adjust the material properties - that's it!

Or, follow the steps below to use the assets without the custom package or prefab...

Create a Projector. (To access the Projector assets, Import "Effects" from Unity's Standard Assets)
Create a new Material, assign the "Projector/CloudShadows" Shader to that Material, then attach that Material to the Projector.
Make sure the Projector is facing the correct direction. (90º on the x axis to point downward)
Set the Projector to Orthographic and make sure its size and height cover the whole area.
Adjust the Material properties to fit your scene!

GENERAL NOTES:
--------------

Use the Color property to adjust opacity and color. The alpha is not used.

Textures are included for convenience, use any textures you want.  Make sure the texture's Import Settings are set to "Repeat".  

Don't forget to adjust the Tiling properties of the textures in the Material properties.

Use the projector's "Ignore Layers" setting to exclude water and transparent objects.

Unfortunately, the projector does not affect grass, trees, or other various objects that use custom shaders.


UPGRADE NOTES:
--------------
2020-02-28
The original CloudShadows.shader has been replaced with this new one. 
The original version was an "inverted" effect - the new shader works as intended, similar to the previous HDR version, which has now been removed because it's not needed.
There's a new distance property that you can use to make the effect fade out at a distance.
Cloud textures have been replaced with a version that tiles better, and looks better I think.
